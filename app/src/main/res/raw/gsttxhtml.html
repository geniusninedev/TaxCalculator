<p><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The Constitution (122nd) Amendment Bill comes up in RajyaSabha, on the back of a
    broad political consensus and boosted by the ‘good wishes’ of the Congress,
    which holds the crucial cards on its passage. <br />
    <br />
    Here’s how GST differs from the current regimes, how it will work, and what will
    happen if Parliament clears the Bill.<br />
    <br />
    The Goods and Services Tax (GST), the biggest reform in India’s indirect tax
    structure since the economy began to be opened up 25 years ago, at last looks
    set to become reality.
<p><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    <img alt="gst" height="186" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/08/gst.jpg" width="100%" /><br/>

    <h3>Stage 1:</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Imagine a manufacturer of, say, shirts. He buys raw material or inputs — cloth,
    thread, buttons, tailoring equipment — worth Rs 100, a sum that includes a tax
    of Rs 10. With these raw materials, he manufactures a shirt.<br />
    <br />
    In the process of creating the shirt, the manufacturer adds value to the
    materials he started out with. Let us take this value added by him to be Rs 30.
    The gross value of his good would, then, be Rs 100 + 30, or Rs 130.<br />
    <br />
    At a tax rate of 10%, the tax on output (this shirt) will then be Rs 13. But
    under GST, he can set off this tax (Rs 13) against the tax he has already paid
    on raw material/inputs (Rs 10). <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, the effective GST incidence on the manufacturer is only Rs 3 (13 –
    10).<br />

    <h3>Stage 2:</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    The next stage is that of the good passing from the manufacturer to the
    wholesaler. The wholesaler purchases it for Rs 130, and adds on value (which is
    basically his ‘margin’) of, say, Rs 20. <br />
    <br />
    The gross value of the good he sells would then be Rs 130 + 20 — or a total of
    Rs 150.<br />
    <br />
    A 10% tax on this amount will be Rs 15. But again, under GST, he can set off the
    tax on his output (Rs 15) against the tax on his purchased good from the
    manufacturer (Rs 13). <br />
    <br />
    Thus, the effective GST incidence on the wholesaler is only Rs 2 (15 – 13).<br />

    <h3>Stage 3:</h3>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    In the final stage, a retailer buys the shirt from the wholesaler. To his
    purchase price of Rs 150, he adds value, or margin, of, say, Rs 10. The gross
    value of what he sells, therefore, goes up to Rs 150 + 10, or Rs 160. <br />
    <br />
    The tax on this, at 10%, will be Rs 16. But by setting off this tax (Rs 16)
    against the tax on his purchase from the wholesaler (Rs 15), the retailer brings
    down the effective GST incidence on himself to Re 1 (16 –15).<br />
    <br />
    Thus, the total GST on the entire value chain from the raw material/input
    suppliers (who can claim no tax credit since they haven’t purchased anything
    themselves) through the manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer is, Rs 10 + 3 +2 +
    1, or Rs 16.<br />
    <br />
    It basically seeks to amends the Constitution to empower both the Centre and the
    states to levy GST. <br />
    <br />
    This they cannot do now, because the Centre cannot impose any tax on goods
    beyond manufacturing (Excise) or primary import (Customs) stage, while states do
    not have the power to tax services. <br />
    <br />
    The proposed GST would subsume various central (Excise Duty, Additional Excise
    Duty, service tax, Countervailing or Additional Customs Duty, Special Additional
    Duty of Customs, etc.), as well as state-level indirect taxes (VAT/sales tax,
    purchase tax, entertainment tax, luxury tax, octroi, entry tax, etc). <br />
    <br />
    Once the Bill is passed, there will only be a national-level central GST and a
    state-level GST spanning the entire value chain for all goods and services, with
    some exemptions.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">GST stands for Goods and Service Tax. It is a kind of tax imposed on sale,
manufacturing and usage of goods and services. <br />
<br />
Goods and Service Tax is applied on services and goods at a national level with 
a purpose of achieving overall economic growth. <br />
<br />
GST is particularly designed to replace the indirect taxes imposed on goods and 
services by the Centre and States.<br />
<br />
Goods and Service Tax can be defined as a kind of Value Added Tax imposed by on 
various goods and services by different countries.<br />
<br />
The tax charged on goods and services may differ from country to country. <br />
<br />
Goods and service tax is imposed to collect revenues for the government. <br />
<br />
This tax is paid by the consumers of goods and services and collected and 
forwarded to the government by the business entities.<br />
<br />
In India, the Goods and Service Tax Bill was officially introduced in 2014 as 
The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment) Bill, 2014. <br />
<br />
The GST Bill in India proposes the implementation of nationwide Value Added Tax 
on sale, manufacturing and the use of different goods and services. <br />
<br />
The Goods and Service Tax act is expected to be operative in India from April, 
2016.<br />
<br />
Arun Jaitley-the Finance Minister of India announced The Constitution (One 
Hundred and Twenty-second Amendment) Bill, 2014 or the Goods and Service Tax in 
Lok Sabha on 19 December 2014. <br />
<br />
The Parliament passed the bill on 6th May, 2015, after it received 352 votes for 
and 37 against it.<br />
<br />
GST is a kind of indirect tax. Currently, Indian consumers have to pay indirect 
tax on goods and services such as Value Added Tax, Service Tax, Excise Duty, 
Customs Duty, etc. <br />
<br />
Under the current system, each State has a right to levy their own tax on the 
goods coming into their dominion for sale and consumption, while the Centre 
levies taxes on manufacture of the goods. <br />
<br />
All these direct taxes levied on the traders are passed down to the consumer.<br />
<br />
Of these, excise duty/CENVAT, customs duty, service tax, central and state sales 
tax, VAT, octroy, entry tax, road toll, luxury tax and entertainment tax are 
applicable to goods and services.<br />
<br />
Let us take an example of a dress manufactured in Surat, Gujarat. At the spot of 
manufacture, an excise duty/Cenvat has to be paid to the Central Government.
<br />
<br />
If the dyes for the dress are bought from Madhya Pradesh, then the manufacturer 
has to pay the state taxes applicable for the dyes in Madhya Pradesh while 
buying it, and also pay Gujarat’s “import duty” on the product. </p>
<p><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Similarly, if the buttons for the dress are bought from Rajasthan, then
another set of taxes are added to the manufacturing cost. At the end of this 
chain, when the product reaches the market for sale, VAT is added to it. </p>
<p><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">So all the taxes paid for the production of the dress so far gets added to
the cost of the dress, which rises considerably from its actual manufacturing 
cost.<br />
<br />
The current system is burdened with multiple taxation on the same object with no 
way to offset the taxes already paid at each stage of 
production-retailing-consumption. <br />
<br />
If Cenvat and service tax are paid at the manufacturing level, these can be 
offset against future payments, but none of the other taxes paid at any stage 
can be reclaimed.<br />


<h3>How GST Works:</h3>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
GST proposes to abolish the varying levels of taxation between States, and 
consider the country as a single whole organism when it comes to taxes on goods 
and services instead of as a segmented creature. <br />
<br />
All the sundry taxes will be clubbed into just 2 levels – Central GST and State 
GST. What a trader will essentially be able to do is claim a refund on the taxes 
already paid at different stages of value addition. <br />
<br />
The consumer who buys the product will have to pay only the GST charged by the 
last dealer in the supply chain, as everyone else would have the opportunity to 
set-off the taxes paid at the previous stages. <br />
<br />
If we take the example above under the GST system, the Cenvat on manufacturing 
the dress and the taxes paid on dyes and buttons can be offset at each level, 
thereby considerably reducing the total taxes paid.<br />
<br />
GST will also prevent the multiple taxation occurring on certain goods, and 
ensure transparency with regards to the rate of taxation and the total amount 
that goes to the government as taxes on a product. <br />
<br />
Currently, a consumer is not aware of the total amount of taxes s/he pays for a 
product, apart from VAT which is mentioned on the bill.<br />

<h3>Here’s a list of taxes that the GST will likely replace:</h3>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Service Tax<br/><br/>

Cesses and surcharges related to supply of goods or services<br />
<br />
Central Excise Duty<br />
<br />
Excise Duties on medicinal and toilet preparations<br />
<br />
Additional Excise Duties on textiles and textile products<br />
<br />
Additional Excise Duties on goods of special importance<br />
<br />
Additional Customs Duties (CVD)<br />
<br />
Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD)<br />

<h3>These are the taxes that could be absorbed into the GST regime:</h3><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Central Sales Tax<br />
<br />
State VAT<br />
<br />
Entry Tax<br />
<br />
Purchase Tax<br />
<br />
Entertainment Tax (not levied by local bodies)<br />
<br />
Luxury Tax<br />
<br />
Taxes on advertisements<br />
<br />
State cesses and surcharges<br />
<br />
Taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling<br />
<br />
The exact rates of GST have not been decided yet. This will be done only after 
repeated consultations on the reports made by the GST Council. <br />
<br />
The rates being discussed as of now hover around 18%, which may be higher than 
the current system for certain goods and services, and lower for the others.<br />

<h3>Advantages of GST:</h3>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
This is a federal law, which means that the states will no longer have the right 
to make new laws on taxation towards goods and services.<br />
<br />
It simplifies the tax system and makes it easier to understand as well as 
cheaper to implement at various levels.<br />
<br />
Tax evasion at various stages will be eliminated as tax offsets can be collected 
only if taxes have been paid originally. <br />
<br />
You will also be able to buy raw materials or constituent materials for 
production only from those who have paid taxes, in order to claim benefits.<br />
<br />
It will be cheaper to buy input goods and services for production from other 
states.<br />
<br />
The current supply and distribution chain may undergo a change with a change in 
taxation system that does away with excise and customs duties.<br />
<br />
The consumer will get the end-product at cheaper rates because of elimination of 
multiple taxes and the tax cascade.<br />
<br />
As of now, petroleum and petroleum products have been kept out of the GST regime 
until further notice.<br />
<br />
Sale of newspapers and advertisements are also likely to fall under the GST 
regime, allowing the government to increase its revenue considerably.<br />
<br />
While there will be central GST and state GST, the tax applicable on goods and 
services being exported and imported between states in India would fall under an 
Integrated GST (GST) system in order to avoid conflict of dominion.<br/>

<h3>Disadvantages of GST:</h3>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
GST is not good news for all sectors, though. In the current system, many 
products are exempted from taxation. The GST proposes to have minimal exemption 
list. <br />
<br />
Currently, higher taxes are levied on fewer items, but with GST, lower taxes 
will be levied on almost all items.<br />
<br />
GST is not applicable on liquor for human consumption. So alcohol rates will not 
get any advantage of GST.<br />
<br />
Stamp duty will not fall under the GST regime and will continue to be imposed by 
states.<br/>

The Constitution Amendment Bill for Goods and Services Tax (GST) was cleared by 
the Rajya Sabha on August 3, 2016. This Bill sanctions a modification in the 
Constitution to allow both the Centre and the States to levy goods and services 
tax.<br />
<br />
The Bill was first introduced in the Lok Sabha in March 2011 and reports were 
submitted around it regularly. However, in 2014, the Bill lapsed as the Lok 
Sabha’s ongoing term ended. The Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on May 6, 2015, 
and further reports were commissioned and presented.<br />
<br />
After Rajya Sabha’s clearance of the Bill, the Lok Sabha will ratify the Bill 
again. At least 15 other states also have to support the Bill to go forward with 
its implementation as an Act. Once the ratifications are received, the President 
will constitute a GST Council comprising the Finance Minister, Minister of State 
in charge of Revenue, Minister in charge of Finance/Taxation, and other 
ministers nominated by states. This Council will make recommendations on the 
taxes to be absorbed and done away with, exemptions to GST and their threshold, 
laws governing the GST levies, actual GST rates and discounts, etc. A draft of 
the Bill is already available in the public domain. Once the changes are made 
and the final draft it ready it will be put up in public again and comments 
sought.<br />
<br />
Once the GST Bill is fleshed out in detail, and the President approves it, the 
Parliament will pass a legislation on central GST and integrated GST, and all 
the states and union territories will pass legislations on the state GST. Once 
all legislations have been passed as Acts, a synchronised implementation of the 
Acts will be negotiated among the states and centre, and Goods and Services Tax 
will be officially active.<br/>

The Goods and Service Tax Bill is officially known as The Constitution (One 
Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment) Bill, 2014 which is formulated to create a 
pan-India tax system and end the number of multiple taxes charged by the Centre 
and the States on various goods and services. The key points of the GST bill are
given below:<br />
<br />
It is an indirect, uniform tax that is levied on the goods and services 
throughout a particular country. Several developed countries add tax on sale, 
manufacture and consumption using single comprehensive tax.<br />
<br />
Surcharge on supply of goods, cesses, special ad-on duty of customs, add-on 
duties of customs and excise and central excise duty would be replaced by 
Central Taxes GST.<br />
<br />
Entertainment tax, entry tax, purchase tax, central sales tax, VAT, etc. would 
be replaced by State Tax GST.<br />
<br />
The primary objectives of GST is eliminating the excessive taxation.<br />
<br />
The 2014 bill deleted the 2011 bill provision that imposed certain restrictions 
on the states on taxation of the products that are important for inter-state 
commerce and trade.<br/>

<h3>Goods and Services Tax Act:</h3>

Goods and Service Tax act is one of the most remarkable tax reforms that has 
taken place in India so far. The GST act, which is also known as The 
Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment) Bill, 2014, mainly 
focuses on changing the Constitution of India to simplify the process taxation 
on goods and services in India. </p>

Duty, Service Tax, Special Additional Duty of Customs, Countervailing Duty, 
Central Surcharges and Cesses as long as they are related to the supply and 
consumption of goods and services.<br />
<br />
It will also include State Value Added Tax or Sales Tax, Entertainment Tax,

be allocated to the states from where the supply comes.<br />
<br />
Petroleum and petroleum products and alcohol have been kept out of the reach of 
GST.<br />
<br />
The act will have two constituents - Central GST charged by the Centre and State 
GST charged by the states. <br />
<br />
But, in case of inter-state trade or commerce, only the Centre will levy tax and 
collect Goods and Service Tax, and the tax collected would be divided between 
the Centre and the State as per the provision made in the parliament.<br />
<br />
Also an additional tax of 1% on inter-state trade in goods and services will be 
imposed and collected by the Centre and provided to the states for two years to 
compensate the loss ( of any) faced by the states for implementing the GST.<br />
<br />
A Goods and Services Tax Council will be created to address the issues relating 
to goods and services tax and give recommendations to the Union and the States 
on areas such as rates, exemption list and threshold limits. <br />
<br />
The GST Council will constitute of the Union Finance Minister as chairman 
followed by the Minister in charge of Finance or Taxation or any other Minister
nominated by each State Government. <br />
<br />
The GST Council will function under the Chairmanship of the Union Finance 
Minister and it will be a joint forum of the Centre and the States.<br/>

<h3>The Impact:</h3>

It is expected that the creation of the Goods and Service Tax act and its
implementation will have a great impact on various aspects of business in India 
by changing the traditional pattern of pricing the products and services.<br />
<br />
The Goods and Service Act will also have a great impact on the tax system in 
India by reducing the unfavorable effect of tax on the cost of goods and 
services. GST is expected to change the whole indirect tax system by impacting 
the tax structure, tax computation, credit utilization and tax frequency. It 
will also help in supply chain optimization.<br />
<br />
As per the government notification, the Goods and Service Tax will be effective 
in India from April, 2016. <br />
<br />
The originators of the Goods and Service Tax believe that the implementation of 
this act would make the tax procedure more transparent, fair and efficient.<br />
<br />
Thus, the introduction of Goods and Services Tax or The Constitution (One 
Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment) Bill, 2014 is a significant move taken the 
Indian Government to reform taxation in India. <br />
<br />
It will help in creating a single national market by merging several Central and 
State taxes under a one single tax procedure. <br />
<br />
No doubt, the implementation of GST will take time, but it is likely to create 
more employment opportunities and economic inclusion.<br />

    unified common market.<br />
    <br />
    GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the
    manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be
    available in the subsequent stage of value addition, which makes GST essentially
    a tax only on value addition at each stage. <br />
    <br />
    The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the
    supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages.<br />
    <h3>
    The benefits of GST can be summarized as under:<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    <h3>
    For business and industry:</h3><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

    <h3>Easy compliance:</h3>

    A robust and comprehensive IT system would be the foundation of the GST regime
    in India. Therefore, all tax payer services such as registrations, returns,
    payments, etc. would be available to the taxpayers online, which would make
    compliance easy and transparent. <br />

    <h3> Uniformity of tax rates and structures: </h3><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">GST will ensure that indirect tax rates
    and structures are common across the country, thereby increasing certainty and
    ease of doing business. In other words, GST would make doing business in the
    country tax neutral, irrespective of the choice of place of doing business.<br />
   <h3>
    Removal of cascading:</h3> <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">A system of seamless tax-credits throughout the
    value-chain, and across boundaries of States, would ensure that there is minimal
    cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business.<br />

    <h3>Improved competitiveness:</h3><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> Reduction in transaction costs of doing business would
    eventually lead to an improved competitiveness for the trade and industry.<br />

    <h3>Gain to manufacturers and exporters: </h3>

    The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and
    comprehensive set-off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central
    Sales Tax (CST) would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and
    services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in
    the international market and give boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax
    rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing the
    compliance cost.<br />

    <h3>For Central and State Governments:</h3>

   <h3> Simple and easy to administer:</h3><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> Multiple indirect taxes at the Central and State
    levels are being replaced by GST. Backed with a robust end-to-end IT system, GST
    would be simpler and easier to administer than all other indirect taxes of the
    Centre and State levied so far.<br />

   <h3> Better controls on leakage:</h3><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> GST will result in better tax compliance due to a
    robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from
    one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in-built
    mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders.<br />

    <h3>Higher revenue efficiency:</h3><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> GST is expected to decrease the cost of collection of

Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services:
    Due to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with
    incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value
    addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today are laden
    with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the
    manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final
    consumer.<br />
    <br />
    Relief in overall tax burden: Because of efficiency gains and prevention of
    leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will
    benefit consumers.<br/>

    <h3>A brief chronology outlining the major milestones on the proposal for
    introduction of GST in India is as follows:</h3><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

    <strong>a.</strong> In 2003, the Kelkar Task Force on indirect tax had suggested a comprehensive
    Goods and Services Tax (GST) based on VAT principle.<br />
    <br />
    <strong> b.</strong> A proposal to introduce a National level Goods and Services Tax (GST) by
    April 1, 2010 was first mooted in the Budget Speech for the financial year
    2006-07.<br />
    <br />
    <strong> c. </strong>Since the proposal involved reform/ restructuring of not only indirect taxes
    levied by the Centre but also the States, the responsibility of preparing a
    Design and Road Map for the implementation of GST was assigned to the Empowered
    Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC).<br />
    <br />
    <strong> d. </strong>Based on inputs from Govt of India and States, the EC released its First
    Discussion Paper on Goods and Services Tax in India in November, 2009.<br />
    <br />
    <strong> e.</strong> In order to take the GST related work further, a Joint Working Group
    consisting of officers from Central as well as State Government was constituted
    in September, 2009.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>  f.</strong> In order to amend the Constitution to enable introduction of GST, the
    Constitution (115th Amendment) Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in March
    2011. As per the prescribed procedure, the Bill was referred to the Standing
    Committee on Finance of the Parliament for examination and report.<br />
    <br />
    <strong> g.</strong> Meanwhile, in pursuance of the decision taken in a meeting between the Union
    Finance Minister and the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers on 8th
    November, 2012, a ‘Committee on GST Design’, consisting of the officials of the
    Government of India, State Governments and the Empowered Committee was
    constituted.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>  h.</strong> This Committee did a detailed discussion on GST design including the
    Constitution (115th) Amendment Bill and submitted its report in January, 2013.
    Based on this Report, the EC recommended certain changes in the Constitution
    Amendment Bill in their meeting at Bhubaneswar in January 2013.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>  i.</strong> The Empowered Committee in the Bhubaneswar meeting also decided to constitute
    three committees of officers to discuss and report on various aspects of GST as
    follows:-<br />
    <br />
    <strong> (a)</strong> Committee on Place of Supply Rules and Revenue Neutral Rates;<br />
    <br />
    <strong>(b)</strong> Committee on dual control, threshold and exemptions;<br />
    <br />
    <strong>(c)</strong> Committee on IGST and GST on imports.<br />
    <br />
    <strong> j. </strong>The Parliamentary Standing Committee submitted its Report in August, 2013 to
    the Lok Sabha. The recommendations of the Empowered Committee and the
    recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee were examined in the
    Ministry in consultation with the Legislative Department. Most of the
    recommendations made by the Empowered Committee and the Parliamentary Standing
    Committee were accepted and the draft Amendment Bill was suitably revised.<br />
    <br />
    <strong> k.</strong> The final draft Constitutional Amendment Bill incorporating the above stated
    changes were sent to the Empowered Committee for consideration in September
    2013.<br />
    <br />
    <strong> l.</strong> The EC once again made certain recommendations on the Bill after its meeting
    in Shillong in November 2013. Certain recommendations of the Empowered Committee
    were incorporated in the draft Constitution (115th Amendment) Bill. The revised
    draft was sent for consideration of the Empowered Committee in March, 2014.<br />
    <br />
    <strong> m. </strong>The 115th Constitutional (Amendment) Bill, 2011, for the introduction of GST
    introduced in the Lok Sabha in March 2011 lapsed with the dissolution of the
    15th Lok Sabha. <br />
    <br />
    <strong> n.</strong> In June 2014, the draft Constitution Amendment Bill was sent to the Empowered
    Committee after approval of the new Government.<br />
    <br />
    <strong> o.</strong> Based on a broad consensus reached with the Empowered Committee on the
    contours of the Bill, the Cabinet on 17.12.2014 approved the proposal for
    introduction of a Bill in the Parliament for amending the Constitution of India
    to facilitate the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the country.
    The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 19.12.2014, and was passed by the
    Lok Sabha on 06.05.2015. It was then referred to the Select Committee of Rajya
    Sabha, which submitted its report on 22.07.2015.</p>

    India merging most of the existing taxes into single system of taxation. It was
    introduced as The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016. The
    GST is administered &amp; governed by GST Council and its Chairman is Union Finance
    Minister of India Arun Jaitley.<br />
    <br />
    GST would be a comprehensive indirect tax on manufacture, sale and consumption
    of goods and services throughout India, to replace taxes levied by the central
    and state governments.<br />
    <br />
    This method allows GST-registered businesses to claim tax credit to the value of
    GST they paid on purchase of goods or services as part of their normal
    commercial activity. Taxable goods and services are not distinguished from one
    another and are taxed at a single rate in a supply chain till the goods or
    services reach the consumer. Administrative responsibility would generally rest
    with a single authority to levy tax on goods and services.Exports would be
    considered as zero-rated supply and imports would be levied the same taxes as
    domestic goods and services adhering to the destination principle in addition to
    the Customs Duty which will not be subsumed in the GST.<br />
    <br />
    The introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) would be a significant step in
    the reform of indirect taxation in India. Amalgamating several Central and State
    taxes into a single tax would mitigate cascading or double taxation,
    facilitating a common national market. The simplicity of the tax should lead to
    easier administration and enforcement. From the consumer point of view, the
    biggest advantage would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on
    goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%, free movement of goods from one
    state to another without stopping at state borders for hours for payment of
    state tax or entry tax and reduction in paperwork to a large extent.<br />
    <br />
    As India is a federal republic, GST would be implemented concurrently by the
    central government and by state governments.A 21-member select committee was
    formed to look into the proposed GST law.<br />
    <br />
    GST is expected to be applicable from 1 July 2017.<br />
    <br />
    The reform process in indirect tax regime of India was started in 1986 by
    Vishwanath Pratap Singh by introduction of Modified Value Added Tax (MODVAT).<br />
    <br />
    Goods and services tax (GST) will subsume various indirect taxes including
    central excise duty, services tax, additional customs duty, surcharges and
    state-level value added tax.Other levies which are currently applicable on
    inter-state transportation of goods are also likely to be done away with in GST
    regime.GST shall subsume the following taxes in the times to come once the law
    is in force:<br />
    <br />
    The tax rate under GST may be nominal or zero rated for the time being. It has
    been proposed to insulate the revenues of the States from the impact of GST,
    with the expectation that in due course, GST will be levied on petroleum and
    petroleum products. The central government has assured states of compensation
    for any revenue losses incurred by them from the date of introduction of GST for
    a period of five years.<br />
    <br />
    The Government of India introduced four bills for GST in the Lok Sabha in March
    2017 viz. the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) bill, the Integrated Goods
    and Services Tax (IGST) bill, the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to
    States) bill, and the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (UTGST) bill. The
    four GST bills have been passed by the Lok Sabha.<br />
    <br />
    There will be no GST on the sale and purchase of securities. That will continue
    to be governed by Securities Transaction Tax.<br />
    <br />
    GST threshold was set at ₹5 lakh (US$7,400) for the north-east and hill states
    and ₹10 lakh (US$15,000) for other states in the first GST council meet.Centre
    and states agreed that assessee up to ₹1.5 crore (US$220,000) will be assessed
    by states and above that will be assessed by centre and states.<br />
    <br />
    As per the decisions made by all will of GST Council on November 3, 2016, tax
    rates would be at 4 slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.Luxury and demerit goods will
    be taxed at 28% plus cess and daily needs will be taxed at 5%.<br />
    <br />
    In March 2017, the GST council approved two crucial legislations - the state GST
    and the union territory GST bills. As the next step, the bill will be sent to
    Cabinet and Parliament for approval. Given the recent progress, the
    implementation should be complete by 1st July 2017.<br />
    <br />
    Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) is a nonprofit organisation formed to
    create a platform for all the concerned parties i.e. stakeholders, government,
    taxpayers to collaborate on a single portal. The portal will be accessible to
    the central government which will track down every transaction on its end while
    the taxpayers will be having a vast service to return file their taxes and
    maintain the details. The IT network will be developed by private firms which
    are being in tie up with the central government and will be having stakes
    accordingly. The known authorised capital of GSTN is ₹10 crore (US$1.5 million)
    in which Central government holds 24.5 percent of shares while the state
    government holds 24.5 percent and rest with private banking firms.<br />
    <br />
    All the existing taxpayers registered under VAT, Service Tax, and Excise are
    required to furnish the details at GST Common portal for the purpose of
    migrating themselves into GST regime. To begin with, the taxpayers registered
    under the State Vat Department needs to provide their details and period for
    furnishing these details are specified for every state.Once the taxpayers
    provide their details there will be no need for them to register again with the
    State or Center once the GST Act is implemented. Enrollment process for other
    existing taxpayers not registered with VAT will be started at a later date.<br />
    <br />
    As the migration process has peaked up in various states, the first step is to
    enroll within the structure on a specified date assigned to each and every
    state. The business units must enroll themselves within the time period in order
    to get listed in the GST framework. The IT platform created by the Goods and
    Service Tax Network will be securing all the details filled up and will create
    unique IDs in the name of every dealer enrolled. This will help the tax
    department to figure out every business unit and can create a different login
    mark along with calculations of annual tax return accumulated on the particular
    business unit. The government announced specified dates for each state to enroll
    all its designated dealers within it and wanted them to furnish the details
    within a required specific time period. The dealers will be getting provisional
    IDs after the enrollment and by the help of which one can login into the GST
    portal.<br />
